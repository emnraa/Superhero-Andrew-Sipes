    <p id="description">
      To our most helpful, kind, patient and understanding professor: all of us
      in MEJO 187 would not have made it through without you, and so we wanted
      to leave you with this little graphic (an accurate representation of what
      you look like in our eyes), and some words to remember us by! We will
      NEVER forget your kindness. You are definitely loved and appreciated, and
      we wish you all the best~

      Thanks for a great class!! I appreciate all the times you responded to
      Slack messages in the evening and helped me with my code. You made an
      evening class fun and interesting and I'll never forget it!

      Hi professor! Thank you so much for all of your teaching this semester and
      especially for your patience with me and my late projects! You were so
      incredibly helpful and fun to learn from and I really enjoyed having you
      this fall. Thanks again for your helpful feedback and for being so
      dedicated to us students; this has been one of my favorite courses here at
      UNC!

      Boom! Hey Andrew! Thanks for being so patient and understanding for all of
      us and I can prob speak on behalf of the class that we would not be where
      we are without you! How do you manage to keep up with us and your other
      job?? It's literally insane!! You're the coolest prof I've ever had and I
      hope we all get to meet one day in the future instead of having to say hey
      through zoom üòî. Hope the move's going smooth and thanks for such a great
      semester despite everything!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

      Thanks so much for teaching MEJO 187. This was an awesome class and having
      you as my professor made uni quarantine a lot more bearable.

      You've been the most supportive and understanding professor I've had in a
      long time and I can't thank you enough. Thanks for helping with projects

      Thank you so much for all of you patience and time! I can't have imagined

      Prof! Thank you 100 times for being such an amazing and kind instructor
      through this ROUGH semester and giving us the serotonin boost we needed in
      such a late class. I enjoyed learning how to code (something I never
      thought I'd say) a lot more with you teaching it! That being said, please
      don't look at the code for this page to save me the embarrassment. (P.S. I
      hope you don't mind me keeping this ‚ú®superhero‚ú® version of you for my
      portfolio)
